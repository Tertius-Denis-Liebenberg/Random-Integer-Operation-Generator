# Random Integer Operation Generator

This project is a simple yet engaging Java application designed to entertain users by performing operations on randomly generated integers. The core functionality revolves around generating two random integers between 1 and 10, performing one of five possible arithmetic operations on these numbers, and then determining if the result is even or odd. If the result is even, the process repeats; however, if the result is odd, the loop terminates.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: Generates two random integers between 1 and 10.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Performs one of five arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponentiation.
- **Result Analysis**: Determines if the result of the operation is even or odd.
- **Loop Control**: Continues generating new pairs of numbers and performing operations until an odd result is obtained.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need:

- A Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary tools and software installed before proceeding.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Compile and run the main class (`Main.java`).

## Usage

Upon running the application, it will immediately start generating pairs of random integers and performing operations on them. The results will be displayed along with whether they are even or odd. The process continues until an odd result is produced, at which point the application concludes.
